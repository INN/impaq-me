	<p><strong>Impaq.Me</strong> is an innovative 'social reward' project to help nonprofits receive philanthropic revenue through proprietary 'share' tools.</p>
	<p>INN has received funding from the <a href="http://www.journalismfoundation.org/">Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation</a> to fund the development of a prototype that would allow nonprofits to receive micro-support payments as a direct result of people sharing stories and projects that impact them.</p>
	<p>The purpose of Impaq.Me is to help foundations and philanthropists support multiple nonprofit organizations that generate demonstrable action through the web, mobile and social networks.</p>
